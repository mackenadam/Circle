# External APIs - Choose your own adventure!

## What's this then?
This project was created as part of the 'Consuming external APIs' exercise during my time at Enspiral Dev Academy. It uses an external Deck of Cards API to deal and shuffle a 52 card deck of cards. The order of cards is saved and cards are moved to a discard pile as they are used. Each card has a rule assigned to it. The rules are stored in a SQLite DB and accessed through an internal API call.
